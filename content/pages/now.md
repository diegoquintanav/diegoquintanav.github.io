# Life

Wow, it's been a while. Last time I wrote something here was mid 2024. I've been living in Chile for almost two years and 2025 was a weird year. I guess I could summarize 2025 as an attempt to catch up with my writings.

I traveled to Barcelona for work, and attended the PyConES event in Sevilla. I presented in the PyCon Chile myself!. I went to Argentina and Colombia. Went to Salento and fell in love with coffee again after tasting on a ripe coffee cherry that I plucked from a tree. I ran my first 21K and it was very hard, and I want to do better this year. I also met the first newborn child of a cherished friend.

## What I am doing now

I'm trying to find a good thing to invest my time in this year. I've come to terms with the idea that I can't do everything at the same time. So I'm going to pick *some things* and see where they take me.

I've put engravings on a pause. I've put academic prospects on pause. I'm going to focus on my career and having fun, but maybe with a sharper intention, if that makes sense.

## The future

The world feels like a it's about to enter into a new phase or something, and I'm finding it hard to visualize whatever is coming about the new shifts regarding the AI bubble, climate crisis, and the new (and old) warmongers trying to install war for profit. It's going to be a tough year for many.

On a more personal note, I want to learn music this year, again, like previous years. But I feel like I'm making progress now more than ever. I also wish to get certified on some things this year. I'm going to keep running and trying to improve. Maybe staying at 21k this year.

I also found that other people are writing their thoughts on a weekly basis and I'd like to try that this time. So hopefully you'll find more things now at [/weeknotes]({filename}weeknotes.md).
