Summary: Loading data with DLT
Status: published

Last year I stumbled upon [dlt](https://dlthub.com/), a data loading tool that attempts to simplify the process of getting data without having to write too much code or spin up complex infrastructure.

I used it to fetch data from some sources at work, mostly from SOAP APIs and it is working quite well. I struggled to make sense of the docs at first and when I managed to get something working I was already so invested that I decided to write this short tutorial to help others get started.

I presented this at the PyCon Chile 2025 conference as well, and you can find the code and the tutorial contents in my GitHub repo at <https://github.com/diegoquintanav/dlt-tutorial>. I don't claim this to be the ultimate guide, but I hope it helps you get started.
