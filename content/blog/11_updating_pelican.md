Summary: Pelican works again, yay.

Somehow inbetween my last update and now, the deployment workflow of github sites changed toward Github Actions and it broke my site. I managed to implement a new and brittle workflow that works and makes me happy that I can write stuff again. I also bought a domain at `301621.xyz` and I'm using it for this site at `bluesmonk.301621.xyz`. I'm working towards a better CI on <https://github.com/diegoquintanav/pelican-to-github-pages> at the moment.
