Hi there! I'm Diego. I'm an Electrical Engineer from the *Universidad de la Frontera* in the cold and green south of Chile. Currently I live in Santiago, and recently I started wearing the developer hat in the [**Center for Advanced Research on Education**](http://ciae.uchile.cl/) in the *Universidad de Chile*.

I am interested in many things, like

*  Coding. I'm proficient in python, with a strong drive towards numerical methods, machine learning and statistics and how these technologies help people and societies take smarter decisions. I am studying about these things in the *Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile* at the moment.
*  I am interested in the whole concept of *Smart Grids*. Particularly power system planning and operation, optimal allocation of resources and energy markets. This is a broad topic currently in development, and I am up to share what I know about it.
*  IEC 61850 and Power Systems Automation. My undergraduate's final project was about *Digital Substations* using ABB/IEC 61850 technologies. This involves the digitalization of communications *inside* and *across* substations, with proper security and stability measures always in mind.

I'm always up for some tea or whatever. Feel free to reach me if you feel like it. I speak German, English and Spanish.
 You can reach me on

**On the shoulders of giants** is an expression I heard somewhere in my life. It means that we should be always aware and thankful of the people behind us that built and shared magnificent stuff so we can work on new stuff now. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)  (Which is also the work of other people):

> The metaphor of dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants expresses the meaning of "discovering truth by building on previous discoveries". This concept has been traced to the 12th century, attributed to Bernard of Chartres. Its most familiar expression in English is by Isaac Newton in 1675: *"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."*
