# üê¢

This is my blog. Sometimes I write about Python and other things. I'm on a quest for ways to do meaningful work. You can check what's going on with me [now]({filename}now.md).

## Reach out to me

Feel free to [send me an email to](mailto:daquintanav@gmail.com) if you feel like it. You can check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-quintana-valenzuela/) for qualifications.

## I also make monthly playlists

I make monthly playlists, it's fun and it works like a musical diary of sorts. You can check them out at my [spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/11102438968?si=gpPHdO6HQCeP4-V3NGnOhw).

## What's up with that bird?

The picture is from a huge engraving [I saw in an exhibition in Santiago de Chile](https://www.cclm.cl/exposicion/grabado-hecho-en-chile/). It's a _treile_ or _queltehue_ and it's a common bird in the south of Chile. If I'm not mistaken, the work is from Daniel Lagos Ram√≠rez (Castro, 1976). Hopefully he's okay with me using it. I didn't find a website or anything to link to.
