* Conversations tend to orbit around Trump's unhinged speeches and the fear around the latest events. I don't know how to stop the bullies, but I hope this does not escalate further.
* Fires are spreading in the south of Chile and it breaks my heart. I hope the firefighters and volunteers stay safe. Donate if you can.
* Raving hard to <https://www.youtube.com/@Switch-Angel/>. She uses <https://tidalcycles.org/> and I played a little thanks to this <https://grimoire.jamesfraze.com/programming/strudel/switch-angel-tutorials/>
* Reading other people's weekly notes lets you peek into their lives. I do see the value in sharing and perhaps shoving tiny drops of my life in between shallow events, to shed some light on the things that make me feel things. I guess it's like one way to connect with other people on my own terms.
* I want a portable screen but I'm not sure I need it. Working in another space with nothing else but my laptop helps me focus wonderfully.
* I dedicated more time than I'm willing to admit into making my `clockify-cli` setup behave like I want. In the [end I wrote up a bash script](https://github.com/lucassabreu/clockify-cli/issues/232#issuecomment-3743939019 ) that I hope helps someone, eventually.
* I read a bit about certifications, and the course I'm taking in [cantrill.io](cantrill.io) is at times too dense or too dry. Me thinks that maybe in the data landscape it makes more sense to pursue GCP or Azure certifications, because they have more extended catalogues. I'm going to give a shot at the GCP Associate Cloud Engineer certification this semester. I did some mock exams and I feel like I can do this.
* It's hard to admit that I love learning, but not so much studying. I need to step up.
* I found out about this <https://infra.new/>
* A ToDo app is a solution to a problem that is yet too complex to understand for us mere mortals. Because we are hoomans and our lives are hardly deterministic and that's a beautiful thing. I still keep coming back to `taskwarrior` but nothing beats a pen and a notebook.
* I'm hooked on Bowie's take on [Wild is the wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tihj-HbRx-Y&list=RDTihj-HbRx-Y&start_radio=1). The original version, I found out later, is by [Nina Simone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiVDzTT4CbE&list=RDCiVDzTT4CbE&start_radio=1).
* We were looking into vinyl record players with my partner. While trying to resuscitate an old CD player she owned, there was a CD inside and we listened to this song by [Alex Andwandter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leAIPV-UcJA&list=RDleAIPV-UcJA&start_radio=1) and It felt right. I read a bit into vinyls vs CDs and I guess I may not end up buying vinyls after all.
* YAML is a pyramid scheme
* Found this tiny desk by [Tim Bernardes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d25O8USd35Y&list=RDd25O8USd35Y&start_radio=1), one of the nerdiest flamengo fans around.
* Science in the end is the way we as humans come to listen to what other things and beings are saying, because we don't speak their languages yet.
