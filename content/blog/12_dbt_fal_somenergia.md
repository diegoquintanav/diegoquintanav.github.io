Summary: Lightning talk at pydata Barcelona 2023

I did a lightning talk at the [pydata Barcelona 2023](https://pybcn.org/events/pydatabcn/pydatabcn_2023/) about using `dbt` and `fal` on behalf of [Som Energia](https://somenergia.coop/). That was my first talk in a while and I was a bit nervous, but I think it went well. I'm happy to have been able to share some of the things I've learned in the last few months.

You can find the repository with the slides and the code [here](https://github.com/Som-Energia/pydata-bcn-dbt-fal)

Make sure to check out the other talks, there were some really interesting ones!
