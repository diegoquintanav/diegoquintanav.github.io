# Life

I'm living in Barcelona. I've been here for a while, and it's been *okay*. I can't say much is going on nowadays, times are weird.

Recently I participated in a [Full Stack Deep Learning Course](fullstackdeeplearning.com), and our team did a project that got featured on their website. Make sure to check out the project at [GitHub](https://github.com/diegoquintanav/fsdl-2022-weak-supervision-project).

# What I am doing now

I'm working at <https://aiguasol.coop>, doing all kinds of software development. I'm learning a lot about QGIS and GIS in general. I'm trying to draw more, run more, play more. Trying to find people to play more board games with. I'm reading American Gods, and I recently got caught up with Saga.

# The future

It's foggy. My family and I are trying to figure out the next step. Everything is going to be alright.
