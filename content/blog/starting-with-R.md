# Why do I want to write this?

I struggled and disliked R after learning python. I came back to it and couldn't make sense of it. It is like smoking. You learn to like it, but you have to ignore the fact that it is killing you little by little.

I used to think like this. Now, continuing my studies, I am faced with the task of using R almost always. I have to learn it. How do I learn something I don't want to?

I'm writing this for those people out there like me. To tell them it's going to be okay.

## R is beautiful

## Tidy Data

> Once youâ€™ve imported your data, it is a good idea to tidy it. Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.
