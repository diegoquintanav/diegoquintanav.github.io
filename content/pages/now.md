# Life

I ran a 10k race and I've lost about 6 kilos. I am also participating in the [_Colla Castellera de la Vila de Gracia_](https://cvg.cat/). Living in Barcelona has been really fun and cool, and I have little to worry about.

# What I am working on

I'm still working as a software developer in the _Center for the Advanced Research on Education_ [or (CIAE)](http://ciae.uchile.cl/). I will stop in August, with the intention to dedicate full time to my studies. Maybe I can handle working and studying at the same time, but if there's no need then I don't want to.

# What I am learning

I am currently going through the tutorial (Or is it a course?) on [Microservices with Flask and Docker](https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/). It's really fun, I've filled a lot of gaps, and I also can fill gaps in the material.

# The future

I will start a [Master in Research in Informatics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/) heare at the _Universidad Polit√©cnica de Catalunya_. I'm really excited about it!

I am also expecting results of a scholarship I applied to. If everything goes right, I won't have to worry about money for the next years, which would be _awesome_.
