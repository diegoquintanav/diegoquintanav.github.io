- Bought a programmable MK165 keyboard and updated some code that worked for the MK806 from <https://github.com/betazetadev/MKESPN-K806-Mapper>. There are some pending merge requests because I got caught into refactoring the whole thing.
- Programmed the keyboard to send commands to [`clockify-cli`](https://github.com/lucassabreu/clockify-cli) so that I can log what I do at work
- I also mapped some keys to a selenium script to check in and check out from work automatically.
- I signed up at a coworking space because I realized I need people around to get more things done.
- Still watching Adventure Time.
- Started listening to the [Música para Masas](https://www.podiumpodcast.com/podcasts/musica-para-masas-podium-os/) (In Spanish) podcast when running. It began a bit cringey but I think I like it now.
- Started an [ukulele fretboard book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/573882.Fretboard_Roadmaps_Ukulele) and I'm practicing more day by day.
- Got hooked on the game [Nobody Saves the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFJZckGdKLI) game. It's a chill game from the Guacamelee authors. It has fun dialogues and the progression is really fun.
- I took apart my engraving workshop. It was a table and some tools but I realized it was taking up more mental space than the fun I thought I was having.
- I updated my blog and started publishing again using my domain `301621.xyz`, a domain I used for a kubernetes lab I mounted with old laptops some years ago and that I still pay for.
