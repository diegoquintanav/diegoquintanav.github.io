# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Diego. This is my blog. I'm interested in how technology can help people and societies make smarter decisions, among other things. You can check my resume [here]({filename}/pages/resume.md), and you can also check what's going on with me [now]({filename}/pages/now.md). Feel free to reach me at [my personal email](mailto:daquintanav@gmail.com) if you feel like it.

My current goal in life is to maximize adventure and to minimize regret.

## About the name of the blog

To me, **_On the shoulders of giants_** expresses a powerful idea: It means that we should be always aware and thankful of the people who did a wonderful work in the past, building and sharing stuff so we can work on new and exciting stuff now.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) (Which is also the work of other people):

> The metaphor of dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants expresses the meaning of "discovering truth by building on previous discoveries". This concept has been traced to the 12th century, attributed to Bernard of Chartres. Its most familiar expression in English is by Isaac Newton in 1675: _"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."_

## About the _Castells_

The picture from the title is a part of a _Castell_, and it represents an old tradition of building human castles. I like castells because, to make one, _everybody counts_.

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iSHfrmGdyo) and then read more about _castells_ in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castell).

On a side note, [Pablo Picasso did a fascinating mural](http://todosobrebarcelona.com/friso-los-gigantes-picasso-del-colegio-arquitectos-de-cataluna/) that features a _Castell_.
