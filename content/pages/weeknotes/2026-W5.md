* This week is shorter because I'm going on vacations today afternoon.
* This week started with some challenges. I need to read more about leadership strategies, how to get more credibility and buy-in. This week also I talked to some people that are going to help me with these things, I hope.
* It's hard to think of one's career from a non-capitalist point of view.
* I finally started playing with MCP servers after a lot of resistance from my side. Since I use copilot I need to adapt most Claude examples to my scenario. I see its power and its value, I still need to get an idea about how to audit these things.
* Particularly about the recent developments of [moltbot](https://prompt.security/blog/what-moltbots-virality-reveals-about-the-risks-of-agentic-ai) is that competence is more important than ever.
* I read code and I sort of understand now, but still I'm running most agents in sandboxes. I can't let the agent perform actions without prompting me first. My guess is that most MCP-enjoyers have some sort of guardrails in place I'm yet to discover.
* I've been reading lots about developments in AI and the [Davos forecasts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2026/01/30/what-davos-2026-revealed-about-the-future-of-ai-and-global-power/) are worth reading. The future looks fascinating and *dystopic* at the same time, is this what always happens, like, with our previous generations? What will happen with the next generations?
* I've seen some repositories of MCP servers featuring a badge with an unnamed animal on them. Like a frog, an insect, etc. I guess it started with the O'Reilly book covers and it's a common trend now, but it is moving in a way that computer things try to engage with people asserting some kind of bond with nature. There's nothing less engaging than reading the [MCP specs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25), unless you are a nerd.
* I've been watching [Task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_(TV_series)) and it is really good. My guess it's about people having to make difficult decisions and there's no way to tell as a viewer what the best outcomes are. It makes me really anxious.
* I also read [this note about leaving management tasks to Claude](  https://flow-ai.com/blog/how-claude-became-our-project-manager) from Bernardo, we worked together in a group project for the [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/) course and I'm glad to see he is thriving.
