Hi there! I'm Diego. I'm an Electrical Engineer from the *Universidad de la Frontera* in the cold and green south of Chile. Currently I live in Santiago and I wear the developer hat in the **Center for Advanced research on education** in the *Universidad de Chile* (But my heart is still electric!)

I am interested in many things, like

*  Coding. I'm proficient in python, with a strong drive towards numerical methods, machine learning and statistics. I am studying about these things in the *Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile*.
*  Electrical Engineering. I am interested in the whole concept of *Smart Grids*. Particularly power system planning and operation, optimal allocation of resources and energy markets. This is a broad topic currently in development, and I am up to share what I know about it.
*  IEC 61850 and Power Systems Automation. My undergraduate final project was about *Digital Substations* using ABB/IEC 61850 technologies. 
*  At the moment I'm exploring Machine Learning and went a bit back on my background on statistics and numerical methods. 

I'm always up for some tea or whatever. Feel free to reach me. I speak German and Spanish.
