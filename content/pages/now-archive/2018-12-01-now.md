<!-- december 2018 -->

At first I was not sure what I was going to write here. The first thing I wrote,
however, is that _I'm okay now_. I'm swimming at least three times per week, I get
to meet friends at least once per week. I learn stuff every day. I get to love
others and I'm being loved every day.

# What I am working on

I'm currently working as a software developer in the _Center for the Advanced Research on Education_ [or (CIAE)](http://ciae.uchile.cl/). I'm doing mostly backend development, but we are working in interesting projects!

- We are teaching Data Science and Advanced Analytics to people from the public
  sector. It's challenging but I'm having a lot of fun doing it.
- We are finishing the development of a web application that gathers data and
  displays visualizations and custom metrics about the education sector at a block level. It will be used across the country and we hope it will help decision makers face important problems more efficiently.
- We are building a data pipeline that will allow us to grow for the future.

# What I am learning

I'm not very well disciplined with my reading, but here is what I am reading and
learning at the moment:

- I started the _Data Engineering Path_ in [dataquest](http://dataquest.io/). I'm
  just getting started but I liked the technical depth of their contents!
- I'm reading [this book from this site](http://www.masfoundations.org/) on
  _Multiagent Systems_. They can be used to design smart IoT architectures, or [coordinate renewable energy generation](http://flexiblepower.github.io/Publications-overview/), and even to simulate human behaviour to reach consensus [on how colours should be named!](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/6819.full).
- I am also reading [Cesar Hidalgo's](https://chidalgo.com/) book about
  [why information grows](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/cesar-hidalgo/why-information-grows/9780465048991/).
  I attended to a presentation he did during the launch of [DataChile](https://es.datachile.io/) and it was really powerful.

# The future

Next year will be fun. I will move to Barcelona with my girlfriend and I will start a [Master in Research in Informatics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/) in the _Universidad Polit√©cnica de Catalunya_. I'm really excited about it!
