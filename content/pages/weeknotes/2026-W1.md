- I went to Cajon del Maipo, a common holiday destination near Santiago de Chile. As someone not from Santiago originally, it was a first for me. Very nice. Discovered many Quillay trees ([Quillaja saponaria](https://www.inaturalist.org/guide_taxa/1975624)), and their flowers are beautiful.
- I'm reading [*Tierra de empusas* by Olga Tokarczuk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220841103), a book I started a few months ago. I'm halfway through and I can't say I'm hooked.
- I finished the first season of [Pluribus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluribus_(TV_series)) and although it started very weak for me, somehow ended on a very good note. I'm expecting the next season.
- I'm watching adventure time on a quest to finish it. I'm on Season 6 I believe. I have to mention the [Jake the Brick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_the_Brick) episode, it was really wholesome on many levels. I found out that it won an Emmy award.
- I ran 16k at a 5:30 pace. I was afraid I was not going to manage but I did, so I'm happy. I'm also tired.
- I listened to an episode of a podcast ["ya fue: la muerte"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fonlo4wVIo)(In Spanish) by the Chilean comedians Ignacio Socias and Luis Slimming.
- After that podcast episode, I watched the Soul film again.
