# Life

I moved back to my country with my family this year, while keeping my job remotely. It has been challenging in many ways but I feel like everything is going well.

# What I am doing now

At the time of writing this, I'm in Barcelona for a couple of months to deal with paperwork and visa stuff. I'm travelling solo this time and I feel like this is a good opportunity to reflect on my life and my goals. I want to create more, write more, and learn more. I'm also trying to get back to running and swimming. I'm at 5k now, but my goal is to reach 10k by the end of the year. It's not much but it's a start.

There's not much going on besides work, but I'm okay. I need to step up my game and read DDIA, which I've been postponing for a while now. I'm mostly working on [pinochet-analyze-50](https://github.com/diegoquintanav/pinochet-analyze-50), a pet project that I started a while ago and that it's been fun to work on. Hopefully I can present something by the end of the year.

# The future

I don't know. There are a lot of things going on now but with clear deadlines, so right now it's more about staying focused and not dropping the ball. Professionally, it feels like I should be doing more so I'm looking how to get there.
