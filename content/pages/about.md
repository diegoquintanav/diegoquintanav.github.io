# üê¢

This is my blog. I'm interested in how technology can help people, among other things. I'm on a quest for ways to do meaningful work. 
You can check what's going on with me [now]( {static}/pages/now.md). 

## Reach out to me

Feel free to [send me an email to](mailto:daquintanav@gmail.com) if you feel like it. You can check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-quintana-valenzuela/) for qualifications.

## I make monthly playlists

You can also check some of the music I listen to in my [spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/11102438968?si=gpPHdO6HQCeP4-V3NGnOhw). I make monthly playlists, it's fun and it works like a musical diary of sorts.
