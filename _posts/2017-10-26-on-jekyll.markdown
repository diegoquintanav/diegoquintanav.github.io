# Guide on Jekyll

I've decided to start a blog, for the $n_th$ time and this time I am giving a try on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [github pages](https://pages.github.com), since they seem to do quite a fine job.

Setting things up was easy. I'm not going to copy and paste the guide already present in both sites, since it won't add anything. Instead I will try to share a bit of the troubleshooting I had to do during the process.

# First steps

Okay, it took me about nothing to have my site showing a humble *Hello World* in my ```index.html``` on my site.

## Creating your personal page

You can create a site for yourself or for some repo you own. I'm dealing with the first for now. 

Long story short, I did:

1.  Create a repo named *[**your username**].github.io*. In my case, it was *diegoquintanav*. You can change that later, it seems. Let's not care about it for now.
2.  Add a file named ```index.html``` in the root folder of the repo, and write *Hello World* in it.
3.  ???
1.  Profit! go to *[**your username**].github.io* and you should see it too.

That was a piece of cake. Next thing you can do is to set up **Jekyll**. This requires a bit more of work, but don't be scared. 
Before doing anything, I believe it's a good thing to understand *why* should you use **Jekyll** and not just plain HTML or **Wordpress** for this matter. Since this is a personal issue and a matter of preference, I can only share my experience and talk about my needs.

I tried using Wordpress, which has a lot of resources to get up and running right out of the box. This is a nice feature, which is also free. In my case, I wanted to have more control over the stuff I was writing, namely be able to deploy my stuff whenever I want. Plus this should work as a first experience running a site. Github pages may be too *vanilla* for the hardcore developer, but is a very balanced solution for enthusiasts like me.

Now there are two ways it seems, to get started. The first one implies creating the folder structure manually, and this process is more or less explained in [this fine post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) which is also referenced by the **Jekyll** site. 

What I didn't like about the post, though, is that doing things manually usually imply forgetting about things. I prefer to stick with the solution using **Bundle** and **Jekyll** from the terminal, which is more or less described [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/). 

## Issues

1.  **New posts won't show**: If you deployed **Jekyll** correctly, it should use ```minima``` template by default. You should be able to add more posts inside the folder ```_posts``` and see them instantly on the ```localhost```. That didn't happen in my case. A short way to debug this issue that solved my problem required ```bundle```. In my case, this post () was not being displayed on my index.

{% endhighlight %}

In line ```15``` you can observe the ``` Skipping: _posts/2017-10-27-on-jekyll.md has a future date```. Changing the date solved the problem.

Other reasons may involve a bad filename formatting or the presence of colons ```:``` in it. You can read more about this [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30625044/jekyll-post-not-generated).
