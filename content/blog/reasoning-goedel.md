# Reasoning

- Reddit Facts vs Claims vs Propositions
  - facts proven wrong in the future are no longer facts, or not.
  - What is known about _things_ and how can we be sure? Epistemology?
- Lecture> god exists is not a claim
- Goedels ontological proof of God
- Questioning of Axioms
- Modal collapse of argumentation

## Notes of lecture

- Argumentative chain: the argumentation is as weak as the weakest link in the argumentation chain. See the claim abobut dolphins and the mediterranean.
- Hedging language > Softening arguments by broadening the scope of claims, e.g.

  > **most** dogs are friendly instead of _dogs are friendly_ because

  Politeness is _not_ hedging

- Steps when approaching an argumentation of any sort

  - deconstructing the argumentation
  - evaluation of the argumentation

- Personal note: this shit should be taught in schools from year 1. See studies about this claim.

## Types of reasoning

- deduction is a form of reasoning > transitivity
- Abduction is another form of reasoning > proof of set containing another subset of information. **Read more about this**

## Quality of information in networks

Information increases value if obtained from within a social network [Hidalgo, Fukuyama], thus claims that are anecdotical are more valuable when coming from friends

See claims of homeopathy in slides

## Understanding fallacies

- Common falacy: Correlation does not mean causation
- Hasty generalizations
- Straw man fallacy

---

## Next class

There will be two papers online and we should provide an opinion about the statements in them
