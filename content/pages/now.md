# Life

I'm living in Barcelona. I've been here for a while, and it's been _okay_. I can't say much is going on nowadays, times are weird.

Recently I participated in a [Full Stack Deep Learning Course](fullstackdeeplearning.com), and our team did a project that got featured on their website. Make sure to check out the project at [GitHub](https://github.com/diegoquintanav/fsdl-2022-weak-supervision-project).
# What I am doing now

I'm working at <https://aiguasol.coop>, doing all kinds of software development. I'm learning a lot about QGIS and GIS in general. I'm trying to draw more, run more, play more. Trying to find people to play more board games with. I'm reading American Gods, and I recently got caught up with Saga.

# The future

It's foggy. My family and I are trying to figure out the next step. Everything is going to be alright.

# Life

I finished my master's degree! I worked hard and it paid off in the end. A lot of time has passed since I arrived to Barcelona, and I went back to Chile to visit my family and friends for the holidays. I visited old friends I've made over the years, places I've lived in and landscapes that were familiar to me somewhere in the past. I drove all along Valle del Elqui and hiked (sort of) to the top (or almost) of the Osorno volcano, around my hometown. I also participated in the recent presidential elections and I'm hopeful about the future of chilean politics. I have been trying linocuts and I got myself a new tattoo. I swam a race in the ocean.

What else can I say? I have rediscovered many things with new eyes. I feel refreshed and happy, and I'm ready for whatever the next thing is.

# What I am doing now

I'm looking for a job! I'm looking to work as a data scientist in urban development, mobility and energy, and/or as an artificial intelligence engineer. A dream job would be where I get to assist with and/or do some research in these topics. Hit me with any offer you have! I am open for remote work from Barcelona, and I don't have a work permit so we would have to sort that out. If you are from Chile, I'd love to hear from you too!.

In the meantime I will get back to my portfolio. I have lots of projects I did during the master's and others that I have on hold.

# The future

I'm not sure. Finding a way to do interesting and meaningful (and paid) work now is my top priority. I also hope to get back to train with the colla of castellers de Gràcia in Barcelona, and to do more linocuts and other artsy things.

# Life

<!-- september 2020 -->

I did the Camino Primitivo de Santiago recently. It was great! What else? I'm running into my third semester. Everything looks fun, and I am trying really hard to understand statistics from the bottom up, for the n-th time. I am reading more, although not much as I'd like to. I have not done any castell since ages, and it's likely that that will stay like that until the next year. Who knows.

The covid situation has made everything strange, so I'm sorry if this reads a bit gloomy.

# What I am doing now

Right now I have a bunch of loose projects laying around. I am doing a short internship with a professor, helping him with some small tasks, and I should be done by the end of the month.

# The future

I want to find a final master project that I regard as meaningful. That is, something that is fun and it will help people, and probably that depends on me, in how I frame things. We will see, since I have to do this project anyways.

# Life

Coronavirus has me locked. I'm finishing my second semester, and I think I have a rough idea of what I want to do for a thesis project. I started running again, and I am aiming for a 21K race by the end of the year. What else? I am growing basil and chili at my balcony, and those babies are growing strong. If everything goes well, I might be able to prepare myself a [Chacarero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chacarero) by the end of the summer.

# What I am working on

I'm fully into my master studies at the UPC. Personal projects are on hold, and I will be helping some teachers to improve their courses. I hope that I can be of help.

# The future

I want to start working on my thesis project the next semester. I was about to sign for a collaboration with a city hall organization, but the pandemic hit the fan so that's still on hold.

<h1>Life</h1>
<p>I ran a 10k race and I've lost some weight. I am also participating in the <a href="https://cvg.cat/"><em>Colla de Castellers de la Vila de Gracia</em></a>, making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iSHfrmGdyo">human castles</a>. Overall, living in Barcelona has been really fun and cool, and I have little to worry about.</p>
<h1>What I am working on</h1>
<p>I'm still working as a software developer in the <em>Center for the Advanced Research on Education</em> <a href="http://ciae.uchile.cl/">or (CIAE)</a>. I will stop in August, with the intention to dedicate full time to my studies. Maybe I can handle working and studying at the same time, but if there's no need then I don't want to.</p>
<h1>What I am learning</h1>
<p>I am currently going through the tutorial (Or is it a course?) on <a href="https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/">Microservices with Flask and Docker</a>. It's really fun, I've filled a lot of gaps. I also can fill gaps in the material with what I've learnt, which is also good. I am also learning Catalá, and reading introductory books to topics I find interesting. I find Oxford's <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/?cc=es&amp;lang=en&amp;">very short introductions</a> very appealing.</p>
<h1>The future</h1>
<p>I will start a <a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/">Master in Research in Informatics</a> here at the <em>Universidad Politécnica de Catalunya</em>. I'm really excited about it! I will try to take part in projects related to Smart Grids and Data Science.</p>
<p>I am also expecting results of a scholarship I applied to. If everything goes right, I won't have to worry about money for the next years, which would be <em>awesome</em>.</p>

At first I was not sure what I was going to write here. The first thing I wrote,
however, is that _I'm okay now_. I'm swimming at least three times per week, I get
to meet friends at least once per week. I learn stuff every day. I get to love
others and I'm being loved every day.

# What I am working on

I'm currently working as a software developer in the _Center for the Advanced Research on Education_ [or (CIAE)](http://ciae.uchile.cl/). I'm doing mostly backend development, but we are working in interesting projects!

- We are teaching Data Science and Advanced Analytics to people from the public
  sector. It's challenging but I'm having a lot of fun doing it.
- We are finishing the development of a web application that gathers data and
  displays visualizations and custom metrics about the education sector at a block level. It will be used across the country and we hope it will help decision makers face important problems more efficiently.
- We are building a data pipeline that will allow us to grow for the future.

# What I am learning

I'm not very well disciplined with my reading, but here is what I am reading and
learning at the moment:

- I started the _Data Engineering Path_ in [dataquest](http://dataquest.io/). I'm
  just getting started but I liked the technical depth of their contents!
- I'm reading [this book from this site](http://www.masfoundations.org/) on
  _Multiagent Systems_. They can be used to design smart IoT architectures, or [coordinate renewable energy generation](http://flexiblepower.github.io/Publications-overview/), and even to simulate human behaviour to reach consensus [on how colours should be named!](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/6819.full).
- I am also reading [Cesar Hidalgo's](https://chidalgo.com/) book about
  [why information grows](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/cesar-hidalgo/why-information-grows/9780465048991/).
  I attended to a presentation he did during the launch of [DataChile](https://es.datachile.io/) and it was really powerful.

# The future

Next year will be fun. I will move to Barcelona with my girlfriend and I will start a [Master in Research in Informatics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/) in the _Universidad Politécnica de Catalunya_. I'm really excited about it!
