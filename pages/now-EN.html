<h1>Life</h1>
<!-- september 2020 -->

<p>I did the Camino Primitivo de Santiago recently. It was great! What else? I'm running into my third semester. Everything looks fun, and I am trying really hard to understand statistics from the bottom up, for the n-th time. I am reading more, although not much as I'd like to. I have not done any castell since ages, and it's likely that that will stay like that until the next year. Who knows.</p>
<p>The covid situation has made everything strange, so I'm sorry if this reads a bit gloomy.</p>
<h1>What I am working on</h1>
<p>Right now I have a bunch of loose projects laying around. I am doing a short internship with a professor, helping him with some small tasks, and I should be done by the end of the month.</p>
<h1>The future</h1>
<p>I want to find a final master project that I regard as meaningful. That is, something that is fun and it will help people, and probably that depends on me, in how I frame things. We will see, since I have to do this project anyways.</p>

<h1>Life</h1>
<p>Coronavirus has me locked. I'm finishing my second semester, and I think I have a rough idea of what I want to do for a thesis project. I started running again, and I am aiming for a 21K race by the end of the year. What else? I am growing basil and chili at my balcony, and those babies are growing strong. If everything goes well, I might be able to prepare myself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chacarero">Chacarero</a> by the end of the summer.</p>
<h1>What I am working on</h1>
<p>I'm fully into my master studies at the UPC. Personal projects are on hold, and I will be helping some teachers to improve their courses. I hope that I can be of help.</p>
<h1>The future</h1>
<p>I want to start working on my thesis project the next semester. I was about to sign for a collaboration with a city hall organization, but the pandemic hit the fan so that's still on hold.</p>

<!-- june 2019 -->

<h1>Life</h1>

<p>I ran a 10k race and I've lost some weight. I am also participating in the <a href="https://cvg.cat/"><em>Colla de Castellers de la Vila de Gracia</em></a>, making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iSHfrmGdyo">human castles</a>. Overall, living in Barcelona has been really fun and cool, and I have little to worry about.</p>

<h1>What I am working on</h1>

<p>I'm still working as a software developer in the <em>Center for the Advanced Research on Education</em> <a href="http://ciae.uchile.cl/">or (CIAE)</a>. I will stop in August, with the intention to dedicate full time to my studies. Maybe I can handle working and studying at the same time, but if there's no need then I don't want to.</p>

<h1>What I am learning</h1>

<p>I am currently going through the tutorial (Or is it a course?) on <a href="https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/">Microservices with Flask and Docker</a>. It's really fun, I've filled a lot of gaps. I also can fill gaps in the material with what I've learnt, which is also good. I am also learning Catalá, and reading introductory books to topics I find interesting. I find Oxford's <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/?cc=es&amp;lang=en&amp;">very short introductions</a> very appealing.</p>

<h1>The future</h1>

<p>I will start a <a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/">Master in Research in Informatics</a> here at the <em>Universidad Politécnica de Catalunya</em>. I'm really excited about it! I will try to take part in projects related to Smart Grids and Data Science.</p>

<p>I am also expecting results of a scholarship I applied to. If everything goes right, I won't have to worry about money for the next years, which would be <em>awesome</em>.</p>

  <summary><b>December 2018</b></summary></p>
<p>At first I was not sure what I was going to write here. The first thing I wrote,
however, is that <em>I'm okay now</em>. I'm swimming at least three times per week, I get
to meet friends at least once per week. I learn stuff every day. I get to love
others and I'm being loved every day.</p>
<h1>What I am working on</h1>
<p>I'm currently working as a software developer in the <em>Center for the Advanced Research on Education</em> <a href="http://ciae.uchile.cl/">or (CIAE)</a>. I'm doing mostly backend development, but we are working in interesting projects!</p>
<ul>
<li>We are teaching Data Science and Advanced Analytics to people from the public
  sector. It's challenging but I'm having a lot of fun doing it.</li>
<li>We are finishing the development of a web application that gathers data and
  displays visualizations and custom metrics about the education sector at a block level. It will be used across the country and we hope it will help decision makers face important problems more efficiently.</li>
<li>We are building a data pipeline that will allow us to grow for the future.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What I am learning</h1>
<p>I'm not very well disciplined with my reading, but here is what I am reading and
learning at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started the <em>Data Engineering Path</em> in <a href="http://dataquest.io/">dataquest</a>. I'm
  just getting started but I liked the technical depth of their contents!</li>
<li>I'm reading <a href="http://www.masfoundations.org/">this book from this site</a> on
  <em>Multiagent Systems</em>. They can be used to design smart IoT architectures, or <a href="http://flexiblepower.github.io/Publications-overview/">coordinate renewable energy generation</a>, and even to simulate human behaviour to reach consensus <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/6819.full">on how colours should be named!</a>.</li>
<li>I am also reading <a href="https://chidalgo.com/">Cesar Hidalgo's</a> book about
  <a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/cesar-hidalgo/why-information-grows/9780465048991/">why information grows</a>.
  I attended to a presentation he did during the launch of <a href="https://es.datachile.io/">DataChile</a> and it was really powerful.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The future</h1>
<p>Next year will be fun. I will move to Barcelona with my girlfriend and I will start a <a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/">Master in Research in Informatics</a> in the <em>Universidad Politécnica de Catalunya</em>. I'm really excited about it!</p>
