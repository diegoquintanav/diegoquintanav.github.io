Summary: Yes, you read that right.

I happen to enjoy the collection of _A very short introduction_ books. It's a bargain (used, they cost between 3 and 10 euros), and most of the times you get very good introductions to a topic. Sometimes they are not very good, and sometimes they leave you wanting to write about something, like the _Information_ book by Luciano Floridi.

On the subject of the _ethics_ of information, he quotes a passage in one of Albert Einstein's letters, in response to a girl who was in the process of grieving the death of her sister.

> A human being is part of a whole, called by us the “Universe,” a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is capable of achieving this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.

(I had to stop reading here)

Then he quotes a passage from Lynn Townsend White Jr.:

> Do people have ethical obligations toward rocks? (...) If the time comes when any considerable group of us such a question is no longer ridiculous, we may be on the verge of a change of value structures that will make possible measures to cope with growing ecologic crisis. One hopes that there is enough time left.

And then he concludes that _this_ is the right approach to the ethics of information, from an ecologist perspective.

I enjoyed this book a lot. And if you happen to come across this post, I'd suggest you give it a read.
