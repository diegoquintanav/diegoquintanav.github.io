# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Diego. This is my blog. I'm interested in stuff like how technology can help people and societies take smarter decisions, and other stuff like   Software architectures, in particular for data intensive applications and Data Science for [_the social good_](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-data-science-for-social-good-c654a6580484)


## About the name of the blog

To me, **_On the shoulders of giants_** expresses a powerful idea: It means that we should be always aware and thankful of the people who did a wonderful work in the past, building and sharing stuff so we can work on new and exciting stuff now. 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) (Which is also the work of other people):

> The metaphor of dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants expresses the meaning of "discovering truth by building on previous discoveries". This concept has been traced to the 12th century, attributed to Bernard of Chartres. Its most familiar expression in English is by Isaac Newton in 1675: _"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."_
