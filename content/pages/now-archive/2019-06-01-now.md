# Life

I ran a 10k race and I've lost some weight. I am also participating in the <a href="https://cvg.cat/"><em>Colla de Castellers de la Vila de Gracia</em></a>, making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iSHfrmGdyo">human castles</a>. Overall, living in Barcelona has been really fun and cool, and I have little to worry about.

# What I am working on

I'm still working as a software developer in the <em>Center for the Advanced Research on Education</em> <a href="http://ciae.uchile.cl/">or (CIAE)</a>. I will stop in August, with the intention to dedicate full time to my studies. Maybe I can handle working and studying at the same time, but if there's no need then I don't want to.

# What I am learning

I am currently going through the tutorial (Or is it a course?) on <a href="https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/">Microservices with Flask and Docker</a>. It's really fun, I've filled a lot of gaps. I also can fill gaps in the material with what I've learnt, which is also good. I am also learning Catalá, and reading introductory books to topics I find interesting. I find Oxford's <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/?cc=es&amp;lang=en&amp;">very short introductions</a> very appealing.

# The future

I will start a <a href="https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-innovation-and-research-informatics/">Master in Research in Informatics</a> here at the <em>Universidad Politécnica de Catalunya</em>. I'm really excited about it! I will try to take part in projects related to Smart Grids and Data Science.

I am also expecting results of a scholarship I applied to. If everything goes right, I won't have to worry about money for the next years, which would be <em>awesome</em>.
