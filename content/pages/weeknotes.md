I found out about weekly notes or *weeknotes* in other blogs (like [here](https://denisdefreyne.com/weeknotes/) and [here](https://janogonzalez.com/2026/01/04/week-1-of-2026/)), and it seems like a good idea. I guess writing about small stuff on a weekly basis is better than one big chunk of text once per year in [/now]({filename}now.md).
