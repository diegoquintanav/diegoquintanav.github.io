# Life

Coronavirus has me locked. I'm finishing my second semester, and I think I have a rough idea of what I want to do for a thesis project. I am back to running, and I am aiming for a 21K race by the end of the year. I am growing basil and chili at my balcony, and those babies are growing strong. I have no worries. I'm at ease.

# What I am working on

I'm fully into my master studies at the UPC. Personal projects are on hold, and I will be helping some teachers to improve their courses. I hope that I can be of help.

# The future

I want to start working on my thesis project the next semester. I was about to sign for a collaboration with a city hall organization, but the pandemic hit the fan so that's still on hold.
